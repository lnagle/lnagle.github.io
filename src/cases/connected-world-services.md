Connected World Services is where I first cut my teeth as a developer. Fresh out of a bootcamp and having worked primarily in Ruby, my on-ramping to the team’s Node projects was intense and demanding. That we were building devops tools that relied heavily on AWS and shell scripts added to complexity of the challenges. I’m proud to say that I was able to rapidly get up to speed and make important contributions to the already very high-functioning team.
