C.H. Robinson is an international logistics company headquartered out of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. At CHR I was a team that was tasked with retiring a legacy codebase that had been in use for over 15 years. My main project on the team was building out the four interconnected screens that compromised the Quote-to-Order process. These screens supported multiple types of customers (one-off as well as contractual), integrated with the APIs of a half dozen other teams at CHRs, and were one of the primary ways that the company would generate revenue through the platform. I built out the UI to be clean, easily understood, and to require as little input as possible for a user to create an order, and thus generate profits for the company.

As well as building out Quote-to-Order, I also took the lead in training new devs on the team in Angular, Node, and Git. I oversaw the architecting and tooling of multiple Node APIs and was integral to defining process and standards on the dev team (code review wasnâ€™t being done when I arrived, for example). All of these things contributed to the major business objective of building out Navisphere 2.0 and retiring the legacy Navisphere.
