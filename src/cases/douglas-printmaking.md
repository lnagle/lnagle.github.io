Sorcha Douglas is an artist based out of Minneapolis who specializes in print making. She wanted a clean, modern site that would provide an outlet for displaying her portfolio. She also wanted the ability to add and edit the content on her site.

I built out the site and the custom CMS using a MERN stack with Auth0 the admin tool. By bundling the react code on the server rather than hosting it separately from the API, I was able to cut the annual cost of running the site in half.
