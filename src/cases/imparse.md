Imparse is a cross-platform desktop app built with Electron. The app uses [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), Googleâ€™s [optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) engine, to scan a chosen folder's images and allows the user to search for those images by their text (think receipts, quotations, memes, text message screenshots, etc).
