Professionally, this year felt like it provided a ton of growth, first
technically and then in soft skills. Joining
Ameriprise involved diving head-first into a greenfield project using React,
Redux and Typescript, all of which were new to me. The first five months was mainly heads-down coding,
with a pretty sharp transition into tech leadership beginning in June when
Chris, the tech lead on my team, left the company. At this point, I was managing
the project I helped to start, mentoring three fantastic junior developers, and
collaborating with my boss and other tech leads in the group to define
Ameriprise’s approach to front end development. Added to this were the
challenges of being a fully remote employee on a co-located team, which
presented themselves once I moved from Minneapolis to Brooklyn at the end of July. Overall, I’ve
been really pleased with my experience at Ameriprise and with how I’ve managed
to juggle the variety and novelty (for me) of the challenges I’ve faced.

Looking forward to 2019, I’m hoping to play an even more integral role in
defining the processes and culture at Ameriprise. The front-end group has grown
tremendously in the past year; between absorbing another team and new hires,
we’ve roughly tripled the number of devs from when I started. We’re now at a scale where
many of the more ad hoc systems that I first encountered
when I started need to be given either some TLC or a complete overhaul in order to keep working effectively. Interviewing,
onboarding, feedback mechanisms, inter-project tech lead communication, dissemination of
knowledge/decisions across the entire group, among others all have potential for
improvement, and the more I’ve dug into these issues, the more I’m excited to
tackle them.
