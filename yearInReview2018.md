# Year in Review - 2018

Professionally, this year felt like it provided a ton of growth, first
technically and then in soft skills. Joining
Ameriprise involved diving head-first into a greenfield project using React,
Redux and Typescript, all of which were new to me. The first five months was mainly heads-down coding,
with a pretty sharp transition into tech leadership beginning in June when
Chris, the tech lead on my team, left the company. At this point, I was managing
the project I helped to start, mentoring three fantastic junior developers, and
collaborating with my boss and other tech leads in the group to define
Ameriprise’s approach to front end development. Added to this were the
challenges of being a fully remote employee on a co-located team, which
presented themselves once I moved from Minneapolis to Brooklyn at the end of July. Overall, I’ve
been really pleased with my experience at Ameriprise and with how I’ve managed
to juggle the variety and novelty (for me) of the challenges I’ve faced.

Looking forward to 2019, I’m hoping to play an even more integral role in
defining the processes and culture at Ameriprise. The front-end group has grown
tremendously in the past year; between absorbing another team and new hires,
we’ve roughly tripled the number of devs from when I started. We’re now at a scale where
many of the more ad hoc systems that I first encountered
when I started need to be given either some TLC or a complete overhaul in order to keep working effectively. Interviewing,
onboarding, feedback mechanisms, inter-project tech lead communication, dissemination of
knowledge/decisions across the entire group, among others all have potential for
improvement, and the more I’ve dug into these issues, the more I’m excited to
tackle them.

After making this list, I was pleasantly surprised to see just how much
ground I had covered this year between books and audiobooks. Around the
beginning of the year, I was beginning to feel bored by podcasts, which more
and more felt lacking in both depth and entertainment (the former for a variety
of reasons and the latter due to the triteness of the format). I picked up 'The
Power Broker' on Audible and began listening to it on my walks to and from work.
Binging large biographies or autobiographies that I likely wouldn't want to
devote time to actually reading ended up being my pattern of listening for the
entire year. 'Grant' and 'Team of Rivals' were the easy highlights, as they
deftly managed to be both highly educational and thoroughly entertaining. My only
regret is that I hadn't stopped to take notes, something I intend to correct in
2019.

On the fiction side, the huge win this year was making reading the last thing I
did before going to bed. This had two effects: first, I read consistently, even
if only a little each night and second, I sleep better. McCarthy, Carver, and
Dueras were all fantastic; the lattermost certainly deserves another read or two.
I was disappointed by 'The Odyssey', which read very dry. By the end I felt I
could have foregone the story itself in favor of the excellent ~100 page essay at
the beginning by the translator, Emily Wilson. Someday soon I'm going to swing by
a library and thumb through a couple of the older translations to see if what
they lack in Wilson's linguistic precision and sagacity they make up for in a
more evocative and entertaining read.
