title: Introduction to Green Software
---

If you’re curious about how software can contribute to mitigating climate change (with or without working directly in climate tech), The Linux Foundation has [a free course](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/courses/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131) that gives a straightforward introduction to the topic that can be finished within a few hours.

Climate change mitigation is a complicated subject (to say the least), and the course introduces a whole slew of acronyms and terminology that one must know to be literate in the space. I don’t have an outstanding memory myself, so I’ve made an Anki deck out of my notes. You can download it [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1857242238).
