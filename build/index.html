            Hello,
        </div><br />
        
        <div>
            I’m a software developer with a passion for building thoughtful, elegant solutions to unique problems. Although JavaScript is my swiss army knife, lately I’ve been learning (not to mention loving) Elixir and Phoenix and studying to become a certified AWS Solutions Architect.

            <h2>Douglas Printmaking</h2>
            <p><p>Sorcha Douglas is an artist based out of Minneapolis who specializes in print making. She wanted a clean, modern site that would provide an outlet for displaying her portfolio. She also wanted the ability to add and edit the content on her site.</p>
<p>I built out the site and the custom CMS using a MERN stack with Auth0 the admin tool. By bundling the react code on the server rather than hosting it separately from the API, I was able to cut the annual cost of running the site in half.</p>

            <h2>C.H. Robinson</h2>
            <p><p>C.H. Robinson is an international logistics company headquartered out of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. At CHR I was a team that was tasked with retiring a legacy codebase that had been in use for over 15 years. My main project on the team was building out the four interconnected screens that compromised the Quote-to-Order process. These screens supported multiple types of customers (one-off as well as contractual), integrated with the APIs of a half dozen other teams at CHRs, and were one of the primary ways that the company would generate revenue through the platform. I built out the UI to be clean, easily understood, and to require as little input as possible for a user to create an order, and thus generate profits for the company.</p>
<p>As well as building out Quote-to-Order, I also took the lead in training new devs on the team in Angular, Node, and Git. I oversaw the architecting and tooling of multiple Node APIs and was integral to defining process and standards on the dev team (code review wasn’t being done when I arrived, for example). All of these things contributed to the major business objective of building out Navisphere 2.0 and retiring the legacy Navisphere.</p>
